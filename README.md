# DoCombine

Utility to merge, reorder and remove pages from PDF Documents.

# TODOs:
- [ ] Implement Shortcut Handler Shell Extension that calls this utility
- [ ] Fix memory leak (? Not sure if it's ever garbage collected. C# isn't my first language) when closing reorder page window and when resetting pages after being reordered
